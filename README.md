# RK GPXviewer 2 <img src="media/GPXviewer.svg" width="32" />
## About
GPXviewer 2 is a cross-platform application to view .gpx (GPS Exchange Format) files. 
I started developing the inital Version 1 in preparation for a tour over the alps in summer 2021 (see https://github.com/RolandKoenig/GpxViewer). 
My problem on Version 1 was the fact, that I based it on WPF. Because of that, the tool was only available on Windows.
With Version 2 I migrated the project to Avalonia. This allows GPXviewer to run on most desktop operating systems out there.
I provide executables for Windows and macOS.
